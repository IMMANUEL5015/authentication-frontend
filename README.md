# Authentication Project

## Notice
This app was supposed to interact with a backend to complete the full authentication process.

For now, this is not the case. It is currently a series of static pages.

The website can be seen live at [https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/](https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/).

There are two pages:

1. Signup Page : [https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/signup](https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/signup)
2. Sign In Page: [https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/login](https://determined-wescoff-1685e1.netlify.app/login)

Perhaps, in the future, I might the features for interacting with the backend.
